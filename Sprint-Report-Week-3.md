## What did your team accomplish this week?
In the last sprint, my team and I were able to get started on development. We were able to initialize our flask application and we also discussed and created some of the tables that we need in our database. We were also able to work on our Figma UI designs, enabling us to have a model we can follow when we start working on the frontend of our application. 

### Links to tasks completed:
* Raymond Adu-Adjei - Task 1: [Initializing the flask app and creating the database](https://github.com/ayomikunolalekan/TaskFlowPro/blob/main/app.py)  
* Olalekan Ayomikun - Task 2: [Changes to the Figma UI designs](https://www.figma.com/file/NBMVyQ8S9XiF3b2UwmyJf1/TaskFlowPro?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ugQ6OCWIoZNvSdBs-0)  
* Victor Idowu - Task 3: Helped in deciding database table and worked on task list feature which allows users to see all their tasks.

## What challenges did your team face?

* This week, the only challenge I think my team might have faced was not starting the tasks earlier and two of us not being able to meet as much as we wanted and also two of us didn't push to the Github repository, so it is sort of unclear if we were able to complete our assigned tasks.

## What is your plan for next week?


* Olalekan Ayomikun: Creating authentication routes like signup, sign in and sign out and working on the create tasks page.    
* Raymond Adu-Adjei: Creating the frontend for the sign up, sign out and sign in routes.   
* Victor Idowu: Creating the dashboard page where users will be able to see the preview of their task/tasks for the day and also working on the task list feature that allows users to see all their created tasks.
